# Section 5 - Btree

## B-Tree

![btree](../attachments/b-tree.jpg)

- Here, each node contains the data as well.
- each node is considered as a page.


## B+Tree
![b+tree](../attachments/b+tree.png)
- In B+Tree, only leaf nodes contains the actual data and can have duplicate intermediatory nodes.
- It is a little expensive but all of them are linked to each other promoting fast retrieval in case of continuous data.
